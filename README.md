This repository provides various small(ish) tools for Rust [tracing] infrastructure.
Currently, the following tools are included:

- [`tracing-tunnel`](tunnel): Provides a tunnel to pass tracing information across
  an API boundary (such as the WASM clientâ€“host boundary).
- [`tracing-capture`](capture): Allows capturing tracing spans and events,
  e.g. to use in test assertions.
